# Random Quote Generator

## Motivation

A submission to [freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com) front-end projects. To complete this project I had to fulfill the following user stories:

* I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
* I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

## Known Issues

If you have adblock plus on, it may block the twitter icon from appearing in the secondary button.
